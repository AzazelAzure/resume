    <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <p>
        I am a driven and self motivated developer.  For the majority of my career I worked as a technician<br>
        With that, I learned a lot about how to find a problem and solve it.  I used that experience to learn how to code.<br>
        I have an appetite for learning, and a need to constantly improve that gives me an edge in any task I undertake.<br>
